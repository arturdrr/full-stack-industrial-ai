# 🛡️ Compliance & AI Governance

## GDPR & Privacy Compliance

### ✅ Data Processing Transparency
- **Purpose**: AI model routing and optimization
- **Legal Basis**: Legitimate interest in service optimization
- **Data Retention**: Logs retained for 30 days maximum
- **Right to Erasure**: Implemented via `/privacy/delete-user-data` endpoint

### ✅ Privacy by Design
- **Local Processing**: Sensitive data routed to Ollama (never leaves server)
- **Data Minimization**: Only necessary tokens logged
- **Encryption**: All data encrypted in transit (TLS) and at rest (AES-256)

## SOC2 Type II Controls

### 🔐 Access Controls
- **Multi-factor Authentication**: Required via Keycloak
- **Role-Based Access**: Principle of least privilege
- **Session Management**: Automatic timeout and secure tokens

### 📊 Monitoring & Logging
- **Audit Trail**: All API calls logged with user context
- **Anomaly Detection**: ML-based detection of unusual patterns
- **Incident Response**: Automated alerts and escalation procedures

## AI Ethics & Bias Prevention

### 🎯 Fairness Monitoring
- **Bias Detection**: Automated scanning of model outputs
- **Demographic Parity**: Equal service quality across user groups
- **Performance Monitoring**: Response quality tracked by user segments

### 🔍 Explainability
- **Routing Decisions**: Clear logging of why each model was chosen
- **Cost Transparency**: Real-time cost tracking per user/query
- **Performance Metrics**: Response time and quality metrics exposed

### ⚖️ Governance Framework
- **Model Approval Process**: New models require security and bias review
- **Regular Audits**: Monthly review of routing decisions and outcomes
- **Ethics Committee**: Quarterly review of AI practices and policies

## Industry Standards

- ✅ **ISO 27001**: Information security management
- ✅ **NIST AI Framework**: Risk management for AI systems
- ✅ **IEEE 2857**: Privacy engineering for AI systems
